OpenGL
======
OpenGL is a project I am using to learn about OpenGL and basic linear algebra. It includes completely custom matrix math and has functions for loading arbitrary objects and textures from files.

Dependencies
------------
This project depends on OpenGL, (optionally) GLEW, and GLFW 3.

Building
--------
Run `make dist` from the root of the project and run `dist/main` from the `dist` directory.
